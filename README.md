**Interdisciplinary artist** & **front-end software engineer** based in Barcelona. Currently, I'm really enjoying using **React.js** as my main framework to build front-ends, and I am learning Next.js and in-depth TDD with Enzyme. Working on art, ecology, artificial Intelligence & V/AR. I would really like to get to know new people within - and beyond - these fields to discuss, help, and create together!
